# Human-pose-Estimation-using-Machine-learning
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing human poses using machine learning. It identifies key body points like the head, shoulders, and knees, creating a stick figure overlay on images and videos. This tool is ideal for fitness tracking, sports analysis, and interactive applications.

By recognizing human movement through key body areas, the system generates visual representations for both still images and live video feeds. Utilizing advanced models like Mediapipe, it accurately detects important landmarks, making it versatile for various scenarios, including workout tracking, athletic performance analysis, rehabilitation, and gesture-based gaming.

The process begins with inputting a photo or video, where the model identifies key body points and maps them onto a skeletal framework. In real-time video, it dynamically tracks movements, suitable for activities like dancing or yoga.

Combining simplicity with power, the project uses OpenCV for image processing and Mediapipe for pose detection, offering an engaging way to understand human poses. Whether developing an AI-driven fitness app or exploring gesture recognition, this project allows you to track movements and assess physical performance while delving into human pose estimation.
